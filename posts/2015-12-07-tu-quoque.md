If you’re in a job where you could be doing a thousand things, staying focused for most of the day can become a big problem. We want to do too much.

Today I’d like to talk about this hard problem faced by anyone doing meaningful work.

Some Java:

```java
class Animal {
  public abstract sayHi();
}
```

Some Haskell

```haskell
f x = x ++ "abc"
```

Some bash
```bash
$ sudo systemctl start display-manager
```


If you don’t tackle [this challenge](http://www.google.com), you’ll be left feeling scattered and unfocused, overwhelmed and disconnected.

If you can take it on … you can create an experience of getting meaningful things done.

How does that sound? Let’s dive in.

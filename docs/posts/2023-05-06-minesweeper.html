        Posted on May  6, 2023

    <p>I wrote a bot that plays <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google%20minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>.</p>
<video width="100%" muted autoplay loop src="../media/minesweeper_bot.mov"></video>
<p><br></p>
<p>Minesweeper is puzzle game where a player must identify field cells that contain mines and mark them with flags. If the player believes there is no mine in a cell, she opens it. If there is no mine, the opened field indicates the number of mines in adjacent cells. However, if the player opens a field with a mine, the game ends.</p>
<p>I have loved this game since childhood and decided to automate playing it for several reasons. One reason is that I find formalizing the logic of playing the game to be more enjoyable and productive than playing it manually. But more importantly, I want to use this project to demonstrate why Haskell is such a cool programming language. While there are many great Haskell tutorials and books available, such as <a href="https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">“Real World Haskell”</a> and <a href="http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/">“Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!”</a>, I believe that building projects is the best way to truly appreciate Haskell’s beauty and power.</p>
<p>So instead of writing yet another blog post about the theoretical foundations of Haskell or its strong type system, I invite you to join me on a journey of building a fun program together. We’ll start by managing Minesweeper’s dependencies with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)">Nix</a>, then move on to capturing and reading web application screenshots using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver">WebDriver</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels">JuicyPixels library</a>. After that, we’ll read the Game Model and build a naive Minesweeper algorithm before diving into the State Monad and use it to supercharge our Minesweeper algorithm.</p>
<p>Of course, this plan may change as I write the posts and refine the project. For instance, the actual implementation featured in the screencast above falls somewhere between the naive and supercharged versions of the algorithm. I may also find it necessary to split some of these topics into separate posts if they become too complicated.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to remind you to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/comm/mynetwork/discovery-see-all?usecase=PEOPLE_FOLLOWS&amp;followMember=tellary">follow me on LinkedIn</a> to stay updated on the latest posts about the Minesweeper bot.</p>
